# RFM Model

RFM stands for Recnecy, Frequency and Monetary
- Recency: How much time has elapsed since a customer’s last activity or transaction with the brand? Activity is usually a purchase, although variations are sometimes used, e.g., the last visit to a website or use of a mobile app. In most cases, the more recently a customer has interacted or transacted with a brand, the more likely that customer will be responsive to communications from the brand.
- Frequency: How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? Clearly, customers with frequent activities are more engaged, and probably more loyal, than customers who rarely do so. And one-time-only customers are in a class of their own.
- Monetary: Also referred to as “monetary value,” this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time. Big spenders should usually be treated differently than customers who spend little. Looking at monetary divided by frequency indicates the average purchase amount – an important secondary factor to consider when segmenting customers.

### The Matrix
The matrix score range from 1 to 4:
- 1 low recency, high frequency, high monetary value
- 4 high recency, low frequency, low monetary value

The matrix is separated using quartiles (0.25,0.5,0.75)
  - Ex. if recency is less than or equal to 0.25 quantile is 1
    - If recency is less than or equal to 0.5 quantile is 2
    - If recency is less than or equal to 0.75 quantile is 3
    - If recency is more than 0.75 quantile is 4
  - Ex. if frequency is more than or equal to 0.75 quantile is 1
    - If frequency is less than or equal to 0.25 quantile is 4
    - If frequency is less than or equal to 0.5 quantile is 3
    - If frequency is less than or equal to 0.75 quantile is 2
  - Ex. if monetary value is more than 0.75 quantile is 1
    - If monetary value is less than or equal to 0.25 quantile is 4
    - If monetary value is less than or equal to 0.5 quantile is 3
    - If monetary value is less than or equal to 0.75 quantile is 2

### Understanding each class
- Best Customers – This group consists of those customers who are found in R-Tier-1, F-Tier-1 and M-Tier-1, meaning that they transacted recently, do so often and spend more than other customers. The notation for this segment is 1-1-1; we’ll use this notation going forward.
- High-spending New Customers – This group consists of those customers in 1-4-1 and 1-4-2. These are customers who transacted only once, but very recently and they spent a lot.
- Lowest-Spending Active Loyal Customers – This group consists of those customers in segments 1-1-3 and 1-1-4 (they transacted recently and do so often, but spend the least).
- Churned Best Customers – This segment consists of those customers in groups 4-1-1, 4-1-2, 4-2-1 and 4-2-2 (they transacted frequently and spent a lot, but it’s been a long time since they’ve transacted).

### What each class means
- Best Customers – Communications with this group should make them feel valued and appreciated. These customers likely generate a disproportionately high percentage of overall revenues and thus focusing on keeping them happy should be a top priority. Further analyzing their individual preferences and affinities will provide additional opportunities for even more personalized messaging.
- High-spending New Customers – It is always a good idea to carefully “incubate” all new customers, but because these new customers spent a lot on their first purchase, it’s even more important. Like with the Best Customers group, it’s important to make them feel valued and appreciated – and to give them terrific incentives to continue interacting with the brand.
- Lowest-Spending Active Loyal Customers – These repeat customers are active and loyal, but they are low spenders. Marketers should create campaigns for this group that make them feel valued, and incentivize them to increase their spend levels. As loyal customers, it often also pays to reward them with special offers if they spread the word about the brand to their friends, e.g., via social networks.
- Churned Best Customers – These are valuable customers who stopped transacting a long time ago. While it’s often challenging to re-engage churned customers, the high value of these customers makes it worthwhile trying. Like with the Best Customers group, it’s important to communicate with them on the basis of their specific preferences, as known from earlier transaction data.
